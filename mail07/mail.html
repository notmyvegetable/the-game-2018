<div class="view_content">Hello dear Hacker,<br><br>Thanks for that, I think we now have a pretty good idea of how to cover our tracks now.<br>I've accessed the admin panel with the credentials you gave me and I've seen that the payment service was moved to a physical room just last week...<br>This is bad, very bad, it means we have to get into the building and do the payments from there. I know the building better than you do, so I will do it, but I need your help in routing my movements.<br>There are security guards walking around and surveillance cameras. Can you tell me how long will it take me to get there?.<br><br>For sure I know one thing, you prefer passing through a security camera rather than a guard!<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Alexander Trekar<br></div>
