<div class="view_content">Hello dear Hacker,<br><br>We've contacted TheBlackJacks and we've been forwarded to you. I'm here to ask for your help, let me explain you. My last job, 'BIENE Corp', fired a lot of people recently, including me, without giving us any severance pay.<br>This is not the first time they've done something like this, they treat workers like shit. So it's time for them to pay!<br>Here's where you come in! We would like to hire you to access their administration panel and pay me and all my colleagues for the money that 'BIENE Corp' owes us (and maybe a bit more ;))?<br>Once we get paid, we will reward you with a great amount of money :D<br><br>I know this is difficult so I will try to help you with whatever I know from inside the company, we probably need to find their admin panel first<br>Here you have their website <a href="http://theblackjacks.tech/bienecorp">http://theblackjacks.tech/bienecorp</a><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Alexander Trekar<br></div>
