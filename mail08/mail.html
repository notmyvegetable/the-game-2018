<div class="view_content">Hello dear Hacker,<br><br>I'm in front of the BIENE Corp building and there is a SECDOOR security door, we will need to reverse engineer the door. I have attached the SECDOOR manual.<br>I've skimmed it a bit and it seems it's a two step process. The door software is encrypted and the key is in the door itself but using a very weird propiertary obfuscation scheme.<br>I've found where the key file is but I can't crack it from here, can you try it for me. Once that is done, we should be able to decrypt the door password checking software<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Alexander Trekar<br></div>
