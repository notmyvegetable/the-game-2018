She a<b>l</b>ways s<b>a</b>id she couldn't see what the fuss was about, and honestly, I'm with her. For a simpl<b>e</b> weeknight <b>m</b>eal, skip the roux. I fin<b>d</b> that the sauce thickens just fine without clumping if I just whisk a little flour with some <b>o</b>f the milk bef<b>o</b>re addin<b>g</b> it to the pan.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>TheBlackJacks<br></div>
